# 3. Get navigation assistant.
When you approach your final destination (e.g. 2km), the navigation assistant will find a closest free parking space in the public streets or parking lots (both in ground and underground) and update your navigation. You don't have to click anything! When a parking space gets occupied, you will get redirected in the flight as well!
